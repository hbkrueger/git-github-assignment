ISE 211 Git Lab Assignment

# What I learned:
I learned how to manage branches on Git and the proper way to deal with pull requests - both sending them and dealing with ones I've recieved. 

# Challenges:
The challenges I faced were managing two different branches and making sure I was making the right changes and pulling from the right branch.
